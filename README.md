Additionally, regarding the Javadoc comments in this library's source files,
the @version and @since numbers in a given module correspond to THAT module
only and thus do NOT transcend the modules themselves.

The @version number of a package should be the maximum @version number of any
of its classes. For example, if a package contains a class whose @version is
1.2, a class whose @version is 1.5, and a class whose version is 1.1, then
that package's @version number should be 1.5.
