Additionally, regarding the Javadoc comments in this library's source files,
the @version and @since numbers in a given module correspond to THAT module
only and thus do NOT transcend the modules themselves.

The @version number of a package should be the maximum @version number of any
of its classes. For example, if a package contains a class whose @version is
1.2, a class whose @version is 1.5, and a class whose version is 1.1, then
that package's @version number should be 1.5.

Modules do not have @version numbers. Instead, each module has a change log
that ends with the highest @version numbers of any of its packages. Hence, if
a module contains a package whose @version is 2.0, a package whose @version
is 1.7, and a package whose @version is 3.1, then that module's change log
should end with a description of the changes made in ver. 3.1.
