/**
 * Container for a general base class that directly extends {@code
 * Object}.
 * <p>
 * Said class, which is called {@code ObjectBase}, is designed to
 * contain templates for {@code public}, overridable methods of the
 * {@code Object} class.
 * <p>
 * Currently, there are no plans to include interfaces or any other
 * classes in this package, but that could change in the future.
 * <p>
 * Lastly, for the sake of using {@code Object} to understand this
 * package's module better, said module should {@code export} this
 * package to all other modules.
